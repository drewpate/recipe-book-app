# Recipe Book App

This is a personal project for a Recipe Book. The idea is to be able to create a card for your home recipes and save them.
The front end is built with React and Material UI.
Currently in the development phase a psuedo database is being kept with JSON-server and a db.json file.

## Road Map

The goal of this project is to eventually build a custom API with a backend and database, with the ability for the end user to create their own account and save their own recipes.
